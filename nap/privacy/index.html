                Nap Application
            </h3>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                João Pedro da Cunha e Silva Martins Costa (Leao) created and is developing Nap (the Application) as a
                freemium application. The Application is provided by Leao and is intended for use as is.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                This page is intended to inform visitors about the policies regarding collection, use, and disclosure of
                personal information of users of the Application.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-headline">
                Information gathering and usage
            </h3>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                The Application does not require you to provide any personally identifiable information and no personal
                information is collected by the Application in any way.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                The Application stores data of your notifications and applications installed on your device. This data
                is called Sensitive&nbsp;Data.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                Sensitive&nbsp;Data is stored locally and only on your device. The Application supports Android's
                Auto&nbsp;Backup feature. Auto&nbsp;Backup may be used to automatically back up your data, by uploading
                it to your Google&nbsp;Drive, where it is protected by your Google&nbsp;Account credentials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the Application can read your notifications, you must grant it access in Android's
                Notification&nbsp;Access page. You can revoke this access at any given time. Android's Notification&nbsp;Access
                page is also accessible through the Application's settings page.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                The Application might collect aggregated, anonymous user data regarding its usage. This data
                is called Usage&nbsp;Data.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                Usage&nbsp;Data is solely used to improve the quality of the Application.
            </p>
            <div>
                <p class="text-body-1">
                    The Application makes use of third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.
                    Make sure to review their Privacy Policies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-body-1">

                    <li class="text-body-1">
                        <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">
                            Firebase Crashlytics</a> (owned by Google, used to collect Log&nbsp;Data)
                    </li>

                Log&nbsp;Data
            </h3>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                In a case of an error, the Application collects data and information on your device through third-party
                products. This data is called Log&nbsp;Data.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                Log&nbsp;Data may include information such as your device’s Internet Protocol ("IP") address, name, and
                operating system version. Furthermore, it may include information about the Application and its usage,
                such as configuration and time and date of the error, among other statistics.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                In rare instances, Log&nbsp;Data may also contain small traces of your Sensitive&nbsp;Data, if that data
                happens to be included in the error report (stack trace) generated by the Android system.
            </p>

                Security
            </h3>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                Sensitive&nbsp;Data is stored locally on your device's internal storage and is accessible only to your
                application. The Android system implements this protection, and it is sufficient for most applications.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                The third-party services that handle your data are owned by Google. Google transfers data via Internet
                standard protocols and employs multiple layers of network devices and intrusion detection to protect its
                external attack surface.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-headline">
                Links to other websites
            </h3>
            <p class="text-body-1">
                The Application may contain links to third-party websites. If you click on a third-party link, you will
                be directed to third-party's website. These websites are not operated by Leao and you should always
                review their Privacy Policy. Leao has no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices
                of any third-party websites or services.
